I am 2nd year Master's student researching on transportation equity and environmental justice. My current research focuses on the disproportionate impacts of flooding on the disadvantaged communities which is induced by transportation related infrastructural planning.

Objectives:
I am a beginner in Python and data analysis techniques related to spatial analysis. However, most of my works require advanced skills in GIS which I aim to achieve through this course.
