I am a second-year Master's student researching transportation equity and environmental justice. My current research focuses on the disproportionate impacts of flooding on disadvantaged communities induced by transportation-related infrastructural planning.

Objectives:
I am a beginner in Python and data analysis techniques related to spatial analysis. However, most of my works require advanced skills in GIS which I aim to achieve through this course.
